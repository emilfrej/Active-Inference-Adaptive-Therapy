\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Simulation details}\label{simulation-details}

\subsubsection{Enviroment}\label{enviroment}

The simulated enviroment features discretized of planning cancer
treatments. At each timestep a ``cancer state'' has a certain risk of
increasing. If the tumor ever reaches the state 5, the simulation ends.
To avoid this, a model has decide when to apply treatment. Applying
treatment can reduce the tumor level - whether the treatment succesfully
reduces the ``cancer state'' depends on a underlying \emph{resistance
state}. When the resistance is low, the chance of treatment succeeding
is high, but probability declines as the resistance state increase. The
resistance state has fixed probability of increasing when treatment is
applied, and it can decrease when treatment is withdrawn. Whether the
resistance state decreases depends on the tumor level. At high tumor
levels, the resistance state is more likely to decrease, but thiscarries
the risk of tumor growing out of control and ``killing the patient''. In
order to succesfully manage the disease, a model will therefore also
have to manage the resistance state. However, the resistance state is
directly orbserable in the given simulation. It must therefore be
inferred from how the tumor state responds to treatment.

\subsubsection{Sim Runs:}\label{sim-runs}

Both the resistance state, and tumor states start at state 0 out of 5,
meaning that a total is six states are possible in each. In both
simulations, POMDPs transition matricies perfectly reflect the
transition probabilties of the enviorment. Two slightly different
simulations are used:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Performance simulation, where a range-bounded approach to managing the
  tumor is used, where the treatment is begun each time the tumor state
  increases above level 3, and is withdrawn when the tumor state drops
  below 2. 100 runs at 4 different probabilities of increasing the tumor
  state is run for maximally 200 timesteps. For each run, vectors of
  outcomes are pregenerated, meaning that vector of whether the tumor
  increases of length 200 is predetermined where each entry has the
  probability specified for the entire simulation. Likewise vectors are
  generated for treatment outcomes at each resistance level, and
  outcomes for resistance drops. This is done to ensure comparibility
  between the range-bounded approach and POMDP models that consider
  different future outcomes at different lengths. In these runs the
  tumor state is perfectly observable, meaning a tumor state always
  generates tumor observation that corresponds to hidden factor. The
  POMPD can only observe the tumor level, and its prior preferences are
  uniform over all tumor states except for the highest. These POMPDS
  only consider a combination of policies at each timestep. They can
  only consider treating or not treating for three timesteps in a row.
  The shortest horizon model only considers one of these blocks, while
  the medium considers two blocks of treating or not treating, for total
  horizon of 6 steps into the future. The longest horizon model
  considers three blocks for a total of 9 steps into the future. This is
  done to ease the computational burden, since it greatly reduces the
  total number of policies to be evaluated.
\item
  In the capacities simulation, a single run of a POMDP with a slightly
  different model structure is used. This model can observes a perfect
  signal of whether the patients is alive, whether the model is testing,
  treating and a noised signal of the tumor state if the model has
  decided to test the patient on the given run. Its prior preferences
  are heavily skewed against observing a dead patient, somewhat against
  treating and little against treating. This means that it will have to
  balance the ``cost'' of all these actions''. It is also handicapped
  further by the fact that the tumor signal is noised, and the
  resistance state, which must be inferred through the tumor signal is
  therefore doubly obfuscated. The likelihood mapping between however
  perfectly captures the maps the expected noise.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Performance of POMDPs vs ADT
heuristic}\label{performance-of-pomdps-vs-adt-heuristic}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "/Users/emilfrej/Desktop/Socult Exam/R"
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{SocultPaper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf}

Four different simulation runs each consisting of 100 runs, of maximally
200 timesteps for different rates of tumor growth (respectively 1. .3,
.5, and .7 probability of increasing the tumor state) . On each run the
the outcomes on each of the potential 200 random variables are generated
and each strategy is therefore tested on a the same enviroment. On the
lowest tumor growth rate almost all the runs reach maximal length.

Contrasts against ADT-performance for growth rate .3, .5 and .7 are
plotted. .1 is omitted since it appears that maximal perforamnce was
achieved for each policy horizon of the POMPD strategies.

\includegraphics{SocultPaper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}

Two interpretations emerge from the contrasted simulation lengths. As
the the growth rate increases, the POMDP seems to run for longer than
the specific instance of the range bounded approach. It also seems that
longer policy horizon seems beneficial. When the tumor state had .7
probability of increasing each timestep, the longest POMPD with the
longest policy horizon performed as follows.

\includegraphics{SocultPaper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}

At more aggressive cancer rates, the simulation consistently to
outperform the range bounded approach. The absoulute increase in
timesteps decreases however.

\subsection{Capabilities}\label{capabilities}

\subsubsection{Learning underlying hidden
state}\label{learning-underlying-hidden-state}

The POMDP structure is capable of inferring an underlying hidden state:
the resistance state. Even though this not directly observable, this can
be inferred to how the tumor state responds to treatment. Applying
treatment for longer time without any beneficial effect would suggest
that the resistance level is high, while immediately observing that the
tumor level decreases would suggest that the resistance level is low. At
each timestep the POMDPs perform infer the most likely state of every
state factor, given their current observation and prior beliefs. Through
custom changes to the `get\_expected\_states' function in PYMDP that
allowed the models to consider how one hidden state factor (resistance
factor) would influence another (the tumor factor).

\includegraphics{SocultPaper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}

The above plot shows the strength of beliefs in t probabilities for a
subset of timesteps {[}30 - 34{]}, and the red dot show the actual the
resistance levels. A time progresses the resistance level increases, and
the model adjusts its beliefs. While the tumor level doesn't increase
durings this time\_period, this would also signal the model that the
resistance level is low. This is the case since the enviroment always
has change of increasing the tumor state, but such an increase would be
negated by succesful round of treatment.

\includegraphics{SocultPaper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf}

The entire run is plotted for the given. Only the tumor level is
observable to the POMDP. It must combine its knowledge about how
resistance level likely increases after applying treatment, and how the
tumor level responds to treatment depenping on the the resistance level.
While the model far from perfectly knows the resistance level. Model
beliefs for the entire run is plotted.

\includegraphics{SocultPaper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-6-1.pdf}

The model begins fairly agnostic. Given that the model was initialized
with a uniform prior over resistance states this makes sense. Thorought
out the course of the simulation it then finds loweer values of
resistance state more likely.

\subsubsection{Beliefs, current/future and uncertainty is
accessible}\label{beliefs-currentfuture-and-uncertainty-is-accessible}

This current simulated model used a slightly different implementation
than those compared to performance of rangebounded therapy planning.
While the those models had longer policy horizons, they didn't consider
the entire space possible actions. A model with a shorter policy horizon
that would instead search every single possible action four steps is
plotted to investigate the structure of decision-making by the POMDP
model. The enviroment was also more unceartain. Instead of featuring a
1-to-1 mapping of the observations of the tumor to actual tumor state,
it recieved a noised signal. It must therefore. The beliefs about how
tumor state will evolve as a consequence of the most promising policy at
time step 14 is plotted, and the expectation of resistance states at
t=24 is plotted too.

\includegraphics{SocultPaper_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-7-1.pdf}

Dotted vertical lines indicated the timepoint for which the evaluation
of expected states are extracted.
