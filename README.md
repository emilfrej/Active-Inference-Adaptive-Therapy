# What is this repo?
This is a term project for the Social and Cultural Dynamics course for the BSc. in Cognitive Science at Aarhus University. 

## Academic Goal of this project
Investigate whether Active Inference can be used to plan a specific type of cancer therapy known as [adaptive therapy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040842823002809). I'm fairly satisfied with the resulting term paper, but do note that course regulations, especially a nasty character count, forced my hand in many editorial choices.

## Personal Ambitions
I mainly did this project to learn more about Active Inferences. I figured applying it to a new domain would force me to properly understand the nuts and bolts of the paradigm. 

Additionally, I've taken this as an exercise in producing reproducible research. Everything should be run-able out of box except for installing python, r and required packages. The final paper knit table directly to PDF from the .rmd file, meaning that if new data is simulated, figures should automatically be updated.
